## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **AI-generated explanations** of key LangGraph concepts  
- 📝 Structured study material for beginners and intermediate learners  
- 🔗 Code snippets and conceptual diagrams (where appropriate)  
- 📚 Curated learning paths and topic breakdowns  
- 🤖 Focused on practical understanding for real-world usage

## 💡 Motivation

LangGraph is an emerging paradigm in building reliable agent workflows using graph-based execution. While official docs are comprehensive, many learners benefit from structured summaries, examples, and analogies. This repository aims to bridge that gap using AI-generated material that can be reviewed, improved, and expanded over time.

## 🧪usage 
- This project helps to create study material using generative ai skills. Made the use of openai model which helps to generate the study material.
- We have make the use of streamlit for better UI interface for the users.
- Multiple pages are created in the pages folder like roadmap , outline , final material , html generation , keyword generation , etc.
- Created a json file to store the model can add the model if required.
- The application can accessed only when you are loggedin else you cannot login.
